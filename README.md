### ðŸ‘‹  Hi there, welcome to my Github! ðŸ˜„

I'm a former environmental educator, turned operational problem-solver, turned software engineer! 


I recently graduated from Flatiron School's *Full Stack Web Development, Ruby on Rails and JavaScript* program and I'm thrilled to find my next career move. I'm delighted that I have a lifetime of learning ahead of me in this field and I can't wait to get started! I enjoy working with Javascript, React, Ruby, and Rails, and I'm beginning to learn Python. I love that programming is the perfect balance between creativity and problem-solving, and I'm looking forward to joining a collaborative team where I can level-up my skills.
